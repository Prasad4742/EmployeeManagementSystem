# EmployeeManagementSystem
#Abstract
Human resource difficulties face all businesses, large and small. Because every organization has
different staff management needs, we create custom employee management solutions that are
tailored to your needs. This is intended to aid strategic planning and guarantee that your firm has
the appropriate degree of human resources to meet your long-term objectives. This approach will
help you to better manage your resources in the long run.

#I. Introduction
Everything has been digitised in our age of ever-increasing technology. The human workforce has
grown as a result of the abundance of job options. As a result, a system that can handle the data of
such a vast number of people in a company is required. Because of its user-friendly design, this
project makes the process of keeping records easier. The "EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM" was created to address the issues that plagued the previous manual system. This
programme is designed to eliminate, and in some cases, decrease, the problems that the current
system has.
To eliminate data entry mistakes, the software is kept as simple as possible. When inputting
incorrect data, it also displays an error notice. The user doesnâ€™t require any formal expertise to
operate this system. The admin will be able to add new employees to this project. Employee data
may also be seen and printed by the administrator. Admins can also remove an employee and
change their details.

#II. Objective
The objective of this work is to give a complete approach to personnel information management.
This will be accomplished by developing and deploying an HR management system that will result
in a significant shift in the way employee data is managed.
This system's objectives include the following:

1. Design of an HR management system to meet needs such as adding and deleting
employees, viewing and printing employee data, and updating employee information.
2. Employee data is stored in a well-designed database.
3. An easy-to-use interface that will let user interact with the system.

#III. Methodology
The methodology to complete this project is as follows:
1. I explored net beans, concepts of swings and applets.
2. For further and a deeper understanding, I even referred to some articles, books, journals,
websites and news articles.
